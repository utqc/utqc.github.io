We are a community where undergraduate students engage with each other to learn and research topics about everything Quantum.

We hold weekly meetings for research groups who go out and invesitgate topics, learning labs where we teach computing with Qiskit (a quantum circuit compiler), and reading groups where we journey through interesting papers.

In addition, we host semesterly quantum hackathons, occasional guest speakers, and collaborate with other university quantum clubs to host the global SQUID conference.
