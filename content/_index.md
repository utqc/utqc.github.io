title: The Quantum Collective
---
We are a community where undergraduate students engage with each other to learn and research topics about quantum computing and quantum information.

What is quantum computing? It's an extremely strange field at the intersection of computer science, engineering, and physics which breaks our classical understanding of nature.

## What we do

- Research Groups
- Learnings Labs
- Reading Groups
- Quantum Hackathons
- [The SQUID Conference](https://www.quantumcoalition.io/)
- Guest Speakers

[Our Discord space](https://discord.gg/UBnRaHuzF9) is our primary means of communication. Join it to see everything that's going on.
