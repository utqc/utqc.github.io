Qiskit Fall Fest Hackathon is coming up! It will be held from November 3 to November 5 with an awards ceremony the night of November 6. Thus, it's that time of year to start registering.

Register your team of 3 (or alone if you're going solo. Or, if you do not have teammates but wish for teammates, we will do our best to sort you into a team). Please fill out this [registration link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeHzhVH_Vc2XxyjXzKN0RNyvbnlNUvO8WRQGpOhkA1oSjhavw/formResponse) by October 27 at 11:59 PM so we can have time to team sort and prepare our server. Learn more about the event in our discord.
