Qiskit Fall Fest Hackathon is coming up! It will be held from November 3 to November 5 with an awards ceremony the night of November 6. Make sure to join the Discord to receive announcements about all of that.

# Hackathon and Challenge Rules:
- All projects must use Qiskit, the open-source SDK for working with quantum computers at the level of pulses, circuits, and application modules. You can learn more about Qiskit and begin getting familiar [here](https://qiskit.org/learn/).
- All projects submitted must follow the hackathon prompt, which we will reveal at the Opening Ceremony.
- You may use other languages to build your project, but no more than 50 % of your project may be in a language other than Qiskit.
- All submissions must be built using an open source license, if applicable
- Projects built are owned by the teams which constructed them
- Teams may have no more than 4 members.
- You cannot begin building your project until the Hack-a-thon kickoff.
- You must submit your project before the provided deadline.
