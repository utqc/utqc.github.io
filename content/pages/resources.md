## Learning
- [Quantum Computing for the Very Curious](https://quantum.country/qcvc) may be the best introduction if you don't know anything about quantum computing.

- [Thomas Wong's textbook](https://www.thomaswong.net/introduction-to-classical-and-quantum-computing-1e3p.pdf) is an introductory book which takes the time to give you the foundations in classical computing before teaching you quantum computing.

- Scott Aaronson's [QIS I](https://www.scottaaronson.com/qclec.pdf) and [QIS II](https://www.scottaaronson.com/qisii.pdf) lecture notes cover the theoretical computer science side of quantum.

- [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) is a library for running quantum circuits, and they have a series of tutorials going in depth on how to design them.

- [Pennylane](https://pennylane.ai/) is a framework for quantum machine learning, and they have nicely illustrated explanations of many quantum concepts.

- [The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computability/) has a few articles introducing the fundamental ideas in computability and complexity theory.

## In the Field
- [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/list/quant-ph/new) is the place where all papers are published before they get approved by journals

- [SciRate](https://scirate.com/arxiv/quant-ph?range=14) is an arXiv wrapper which quantum researchers use to upvote and comment on the most cutting edge papers.

- [Quantum Grad](https://www.quantumgrad.com/) has articles and information on internship and research opportunities.

## Community
- [Shtetl Optimized](https://scottaaronson.blog/) is Scott Aaronson's blog. He's both a theoretical computer scientist and a clever guy with a blog.

- [Musty Thoughts](https://www.mustythoughts.com/) is a blog that does a great job at explaining concepts for people who aren't already experts in quantum computing.

- [Quantum Frontiers](https://quantumfrontiers.com/) is a blog by the Institute for Quantum Information and Matter at Caltech
